The schematics for all shipped AmpliPi units are available in this directory.
This document details the specific board versions that were shipped together.

Board versions consist of a number and a letter.
A number change indicates a change to the PCB.
A letter change indicates a change to the schematics only.
Schematic changes could include part number changes, DNPs, etc.

## Early Bird Units and Kickstarter Campaign Part 1
The 10 Early Bird Kickstarter backers' units,
as well as the first 15 of the rest of the Kickstarter Campaign backers.
The overall goal of these hardware changes was to further reduce noise
and to improve fan control.
