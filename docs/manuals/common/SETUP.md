This setup guide assumes that you have followed the quick start guide earlier in this manual. This section applies to the setup of more complicated / niche usecases of AmpliPro, this section is unlikely to contain information useful for the common customer:

Home PA / doorbell integration - Plug whatever is running the PA system / doorbell into the aux input in the back of the amplipi, whenever there is an announcement it will play to all zones. For a wireless solution, look at the /announce endpoint in Settings -> About -> Browsable API

Surround Sound TV - First, check what type of connector your TV has; typically SPDIF or AUX out. depending on which output it has, you'll need to get an adapter to convert that output to RCA and then plug it in to an RCA output on the unit. We also suggest naming the input after the location of the TV and even having a preset that turns the audio source to the TV for the TV room

DLNA - AmpliPi does not currently support native song selection. To make use of a DLNA stream, you will have to use a third party app. The app we've generally used is [Hi-Fi Cast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.findhdmusic.app.upnpcast&hl=en_US&gl=US)

Seasonal Outdoor Speakers - Speakers that need to be removed in the winter / hurricane season can be managed with AmpliPi, simply go to the settings and deactivate that zone when the speakers aren't installed, and reactivate the zone once they're reinstalled later on. **WARNING: DO NOT LEAVE LOOSE WIRES EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS WITHOUT TAKING PROPER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS**

Passive Subwoofer - Note that our units **DO NOT** support bridging of any kind without third party modification, which would void your warranty. To run a subwoofer of this type, you may need a Stereo to Mono converter
