# Warranty and Return information
## 1-Year Limited Warranty

We take great pride in our products, and your satisfaction is truly our top priority. We guarantee AmpliPro hardware to be free of defects in material or workmanship under normal use during the warranty period. This warranty covers AmpliPro units sold directly by MicroNova LLC through this website, as well as authorized distributors.

The warranty period shall last 1 year, beginning from the date that you receive your AmpliPro unit (based upon the tracking information from your shipment.) During this warranty period, MicroNova LLC will repair or replace, at no charge, the AmpliPro unit (or components within that AmpliPro unit) that prove defective under normal use. The replacement unit or component assumes the remaining warranty of the original unit. This warranty does not cover products damaged by accident, misuse, or by third-party equipment. Note that for international orders, we are unable to cover shipping costs or any duties incurred as part of the warranty work.

We test each and every AmpliPro unit thoroughly before shipping to you, but we are only human. If you believe your item has an issue, please contact our support team at support@micro-nova.com to help diagnose and resolve the issue. Most issues can be resolved by working with our team. AmpliPro is a new and evolving open-source product, and we ask for your patience and understanding as we address any issues you may encounter. Everyoneâ€™s home audio setup is unique, and we cannot anticipate and test for all possible permutations, but we will do our best to make AmpliPro work for you! Remember that we are in this together, and by working with the MicroNova team and the AmpliPro open source community to resolve issues, you are helping fix the issue not just for yourself, but for the whole community!

AmpliPro is a radically open product, with open-source software, firmware, and schematics. While we encourage users to modify AmpliPro to meet their needs, our warranty understandably cannot cover hardware that has been modified by end users. Should you encounter issues while making modifications, we will do our best to support you in any way that we can, including making replacement components available to you at a reasonable cost.

We at MicroNova reserve the right to extend this warranty **at our discretion**. There is no right to a further extended warranty, though some customers may receive such treatment **at our discretion**.

## 30-Day Return Policy

If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with AmpliPro, you may return it in its original condition within 30 days from the date that you receive your AmpliPro unit (based upon the tracking information from your shipment) for a refund. This warranty covers AmpliPro units sold directly by MicroNova LLC through this website. Buyer is responsible for return shipment costs and must use a shipping carrier that provides tracking information. We will promptly issue your refund upon receipt of your return. Note that for international orders, we are unable to refund original shipping costs or any duties incurred.

We encourage anyone considering returning their unit to contact our support team at support@micro-nova.com to try and resolve any issues you are encountering!
