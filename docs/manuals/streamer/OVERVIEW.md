# Overview
AmpliPro™ is a multi-room/-zone home audio controller and amplifier made for whole-home audio systems with many zones. It can play up to 4 simultaneous audio streams (Airplay™, Pandora®, Spotify Connect™, etc.) with each routed to one or many zones, all of which are configurable in real-time using the mobile apps (see QR codes on the first page of this manual), self-hosted AmpliPi Web App, or the underlying REST API.
