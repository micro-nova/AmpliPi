# Installation
## Overview
It's time to power on your AmpliPro Streamer and try it out. To avoid damaging your device, please read through this guide before installing and powering your AmpliPro Streamer!

## Mounting and Placement

AmpliPro Streamer ships with built-in 19" rackmount ears, so that they can be easily installed into a server rack. Also included are four silicone "feet" if you prefer to run the Streamer from a shelf.
The weight of the device is approximately 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms)

Some things to keep in mind to avoid overheating your Streamer:
- Don't block the vent holes on the side
- Don't allow dust to build up inside the unit. See cleaning instructions on the safety page for more details.


## Speakers and Amplifiers
Each of your Streamer's sources outputs as a line-level RCA output pair. These outputs can be used to connect to amplifiers, powered subwoofers, and other active/powered speakers. Unlike with a standard edition AmpliPro, there are no in-app volume controls; volume is intended to be controlled by whatever amplifier or powered speaker solution you choose.

### More Info

More information on installation can be found in AmpliProâ€™s community forums, or our blog. The community forums can be reached from the system settings, simply click on "About", then the "Community" link and see the "Installation and Getting Started" topic on our discourse group, also accessible at amplipi.discourse.group. Our blog can be found at blog.amplipro.com. Both of these links can be found on the QR codes page at the start of this manual.


## Power

Plug the AmpliPro Streamer into a wall outlet. The ON/STANDBY will turn solid blue once the unit is fully powered on. Continue below to enjoy your unit!

## Startup and Configuration
Now that the AmpliPro Streamer is powered on, it's time to use the software. To access the app, there are two options:

### Mobile App

1. We offer mobile apps available on Android and iOS, simply search for "Amplipi" on the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store or go to the Links page at the start of this manual for QR codes for each version
2. Once you have the app downloaded, permit the app to access devices on your local network. The app will automatically search your network for active AmpliPro units.
3. If you have multiple controllers (main units or streamers), it will ask which unit you wish to connect to. We suggest giving different hostnames to each unit if you have multiple controllers on the same network for this reason.

### Webapp

Simply enter "amplipi.local" into a web browser, on any device that both has a web browser and is connected to the same network. Android and Windows 7 users will need to type the IP address found on the unit's display into their web browser instead.

### From the app:

1. Click the plus (+) icon and select a stream
  - The Groove Salad - InternetRadio stream comes preconfigured (needs an internet connection).
2. Click on the record/disc icon at the bottom of the screen to enter the player view, which has more controls depending on the stream type.
3. If you wish to change the default group and zone names or add different streaming sources, click on the gear icon on the bottom right to reach the settings page where you can configure inputs and zones.
