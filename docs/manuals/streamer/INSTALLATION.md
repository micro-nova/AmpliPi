# Installation
## Overview
It's time to power on your AmpliPro Streamer and try it out. To avoid damaging your device, please read through this guide before installing and powering your AmpliPro Streamer!

## Mounting and Placement

AmpliPro Streamer ships with built-in 19" rackmount ears, so that they can be easily installed into a server rack. Also included are four silicone "feet" if you prefer to run the Streamer from a shelf.
The weight of the device is approximately 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms)

Some things to keep in mind to avoid overheating your Streamer:
- Don't block the vent holes on the side
- Don't allow dust to build up inside the unit. See cleaning instructions on the safety page for more details.


## Speakers and Amplifiers
Each of your Streamer's sources outputs as a line-level RCA output pair. These outputs can be used to connect to amplifiers, powered subwoofers, and other active/powered speakers. Unlike with a standard edition AmpliPro, there are no in-app volume controls; volume is intended to be controlled by whatever amplifier or powered speaker solution you choose.

### More Info

More information on installation can be found on the [AmpliPro community forums](https://www.amplipi.com/community) or our [main website](https://www.amplipro.com). These links can also be found on the "About" page in your system's settings, or on the links page reached via the QR code at the start of this manual.


## Power

Plug the AmpliPro Streamer into a wall outlet. The ON/STANDBY will turn solid blue once the unit is fully powered on. Continue below to enjoy your unit!

## Startup and Configuration
Now that the AmpliPro Streamer is powered on, it's time to use the software. To access the app, there are two options:

### Mobile App

1. We offer mobile apps available on Android and iOS, simply search for "Amplipi" on the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store or go to the Links page at the start of this manual, scan the QR code, and click "Apps". Otherwise, follow this link on a mobile device: https://www.amplipi.com/app.
2. Once you have the app downloaded, permit the app to access devices on your local network. The app will automatically search your network for active AmpliPro units.
3. If you have multiple controllers (main units or streamers), it will ask which unit you wish to connect to. We suggest giving different hostnames to each unit if you have multiple controllers on the same network for this reason.

### Webapp

Simply enter "amplipi.local" into a web browser, on any device that both has a web browser and is connected to the same network. Android and Windows 7 users will need to type the IP address found on the unit's display into their web browser instead.

### From the App

Here, we give a basic rundown of the app. For more detail please refer to our blog by scanning the QR code at the start of the manual or by going to https://www.amplipi.com/blog where you can find more detailed articles on how to use the app or use third-party integrations such as Nice (formerly ELAN) and more.
