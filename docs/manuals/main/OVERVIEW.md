# Overview
AmpliPro™ is a multi-room/-zone home audio controller and amplifier made for whole-home audio systems with many zones. It can play up to 4 simultaneous audio streams (Airplay™, Pandora®, Spotify Connect™, etc.) or sources (RCA inputs), each routed to one or many zones, all of which are configurable in real-time using the mobile apps (see QR codes on the first page of this manual), self-hosted AmpliPi Web App, or the underlying REST API. It is expandable up to 36 zones using AmpliPro Expanders.

Your AmpliPro controller includes the following components:

- 1 x User Manual

- 6 x 4-pin Euroblock connectors (for speaker connections)

The following optional accessories are available and can be purchased separately:

## App

AmpliPro hosts a web app (referred to as "AmpliPi") that can control the system from any PC or mobile phone on the local network. It is designed with the idea that each of the four audio sources could be controlled separately by different people in the house.
