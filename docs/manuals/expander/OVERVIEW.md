It can play up to 4 simultaneous audio streams (Airplay™, Pandora®, Spotify Connect™, etc.) or sources (RCA inputs), each routed to one or many zones, all of which are configurable in real-time using the mobile apps (see QR codes on the first page of this manual), self-hosted AmpliPi Web App, or the underlying REST API.
