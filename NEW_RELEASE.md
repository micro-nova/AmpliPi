## Versioning
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Here are some examples of versions we've used before:
* `0.2.1`: this is a public general-availability bugfix release of the `0.2` feature release.
* `0.3.0-alpha.0` is the first alpha release of the `0.3` feature release.

## Making a release
- [ ] Ensure the PR(s) with your features & fixes are merged into `main`.
- [ ] Create & merge a branch/PR off `main` to bump the version in the CHANGELOG and also using `poetry version ${VERSION}`
- [ ] Create another branch off `main` named the version number (ie, `0.3.0`.)
- [ ] Build the webapp in `web` with `npm run build` and force add the changes with `git add -f web/dist; git commit -m "Build web app for release"`
- [ ] Update the API by running the `scripts/create_spec` script and commit the resulting changes to `docs/amplipi_api.yaml` with `git commit --patch -m "Update API specification used by GitHub Pages"`
- [ ] Tag the changes so we can make a release on GitHub: `git tag -as ${VERSION} -m '' && git push origin ${VERSION}`
- [ ] Make a release using the GitHub interface
- [ ] Remove the branch (but not the tag) from Github, or else the ref is ambiguous to Github and the updater fails to download the right tarball.
- [ ] Use the AmpliPi updater to update to the release
- [ ] Test it again! If it needs changes, pull request your bugfixes against `main` and stamp a new release ðŸ˜Ž
